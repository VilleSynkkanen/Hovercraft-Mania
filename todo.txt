IDEA: trackmania + wipeout

Core features:
-time trial
-online leaderboards

Track features:
-boost pads
-slow down pads

Potential additions:
-online leaderboard (with dev time to challenge, cheat prevention [binary save?])
-more polish

Issues:
-occasionally bouncy physics
-track map inaccuracy (track centers should be adjusted)
-laps might not be registered (rare)
	-hitting the same sector hitbox multiple times???
